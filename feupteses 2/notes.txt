  Valid data is usually either scarce, expensive, or not readily available \cite{Kar_2019_ICCV}
  A small dataset is also insufficient to produce an accurate prediction model. Even in cases where a large amount of data is available, the use of it may infringe privacy policies (a common problem when entering the medical field \cite{s19051181}
  These problems represent an accumulation of problematic data that leads to incorrect results \cite{10.1145/3158346}
  Synthetic datasets have a proven track record of improving ML effectiveness by providing a better dataset with fewer data imbalances than its "organic" bredren \cite{anantrasirichai2019deep, Arvanitis2021.02.11.21250741}
  Despite being referenced in many studies, meta-features are not uniformly described \cite{rivolli2019characterizing}
  Outliers should exist in a dataset as they contain useful information \cite{10.1145/342009.335437}
